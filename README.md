## 📝 Excel Format

Ensure your `sample.xlsx` looks like this:

| Name       | Email                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |

| Jane Smith | [janesmith@gmail.com](mailto:janesmith@gmail.com) |

A `Food Insecurity` column will be added/updated automatically.

## 🛡️ Safety Tips

* Do **not** share your App Password.
* Gmail may rate-limit if too many emails are sent at once. Add `time.sleep(1)` between sends.
* Always test with your own email first before bulk sending.
